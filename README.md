# DC-DC Buck Converter Project
This project aims to design a straightforward yet efficient DC-DC Buck converter tailored for a various voltage inputs and outputs.
Design done for Drexel's IEEE PCB Design Committee Workshop, I intend to fab, assemble, and test this eventually.

## Power Specs
- Input voltage: 12V
- Output voltage: 3.3V 
- Current rating: 0-3A

## PCB Specs
- Board Dimension: 2 x 2 in^2
- Mounting Holes: 3mm
- Layers: 4

**Note:** Currently a WIP, will be updated as time goes on.
